# Project Reflection

## Implementation Overview

### Architecture
- Successfully implemented a clean React application with TypeScript
- Used modern React patterns (hooks, context, functional components)
- Implemented proper state management with Context API and useReducer
- Clear separation of concerns between components, hooks, and services

### Key Components
1. **UserTable**
   - Displays user data in a grid layout
   - Handles user selection and deletion
   - Implements proper event handling and propagation

2. **UserDetailModal**
   - Shows detailed user information
   - Implements proper modal behavior
   - Includes accessibility features

3. **UserContext**
   - Manages global application state
   - Handles loading, error, and data states
   - Implements proper action dispatching

### Recent Fixes and Improvements

#### Type System Improvements
- Fixed type imports using `import type` syntax
- Corrected type mismatches in component props
- Improved type safety in API calls and state management

#### Code Structure Improvements
- Fixed component exports (default vs named exports)
- Improved file formatting and readability
- Enhanced error handling in API calls

#### State Management Refinements
- Updated `selectUser` function to handle User objects directly
- Improved state updates in reducer
- Enhanced error handling in async operations

## Challenges Faced

### Type System
- **Challenge**: Type mismatches between components and hooks
- **Solution**: Updated type definitions and improved type imports
- **Lesson**: Always use proper type imports and maintain consistent types across components

### State Management
- **Challenge**: Complex state updates with multiple actions
- **Solution**: Implemented a clear reducer pattern with typed actions
- **Lesson**: Type-safe state management reduces runtime errors

### Component Communication
- **Challenge**: Prop drilling and event handling
- **Solution**: Used Context API for global state and proper event propagation
- **Lesson**: Clear component boundaries and proper event handling improve maintainability

## Best Practices Implemented

### TypeScript
